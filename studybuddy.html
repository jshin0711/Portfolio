    <div id="competitiveAnalysis">
      <h1>Understand</h1>
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        In order to understand the current market for vocabulary apps, I completed a competitive analysis of three apps. I focused on four topics for this analysis based on the functional requirements of the project - onboarding, menu, uploading and
        reviewing vocabulary. The learnings from this analysis carried throughout the entirety of the project to the prototyping.
      </p>

      <h2>Quizlet</h2>
      <em>Pros</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Onboarding: Builds credibility by including stats of benefits current users enjoy</li>
        <li>Onboarding: Progressive onboarding process feels natural to users</li>
        <li>Menu: Use of commonly recognized icons in top and bottom navigation bars</li>
        <li>Uploading vocab: Auto-fill option is efficient</li>
        <li>Uploading vocab: Allows users to organize new vocabulary into categories</li>
        <li>Reviewing vocab: Many ways of learning vocab - flashcards, writing & matching, tests</li>
        <li>Other: Offline studying option</li>
      </ul>
      <em>Cons</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Onboarding: Sign up/login required</li>
        <li>Uploading vocab: Valuable features that set Quizlet apart (ex. Add photo to definition, take picture of text to auto-upload vocabulary) are only accessible through a paid subscription account</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Word of the Day</h2>
      <em>Pros</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Onboarding: Use of a progress bar</li>
        <li>Onboarding: Builds credibility by including stats of benefits current users enjoy</li>
        <li>Reviewing vocab: Use of notifications help users to see and learn vocabulary throughout their day</li>
        <li>Other: “Challenge a Friend” feature allows social interaction through the app</li>
        <li>Other: Customize to light or dark theme</li>
      </ul>
      <em>Cons</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Onboarding: Long onboarding process</li>
        <li>Onboarding: Can be improved through streamlining graphics</li>
        <li>Onboarding: Possibly frustrating because user cannot move back and forth to edit answers</li>
        <li>Onboarding: Three advertisements for paid subscription version of the app feels pushy</li>
        <li>Menu: Use of unique icons in top and bottom navigation bars makes app difficult to learn for first time users</li>
        <li>Uploading vocab: Does not allow users to upload their own vocabulary</li>
        <li>Reviewing vocab: Only one way to review vocab - read word and definition</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Word Up</h2>
      <em>Pros</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Onboarding: Does not require sign up/login right away</li>
        <li>Reviewing vocab: Multiple definitions and culturally relevant context of words</li>
        <li>Reviewing vocab: Test option to master vocabulary</li>
        <li>Other: “Challenge a Friend” feature allows social interaction through the app</li>
        <li>Other: Customize to light or dark theme</li>
        <li>Other: Alarm/reminder available</li>
        <li>Other: User can customize text size</li>
      </ul>
      <em>Cons</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Onboarding: Unclear and not linear process feels confusing</li>
        <li>Onboarding: Lack of onboarding to learn the features of the app</li>
        <li>Menu: Repetitive elements in the left menu and bottom navigation bar</li>
        <li>Menu: Information architecture feels unintuitive and inefficient</li>
        <li>Menu: One of the bottom nav icons leads to a whole page dedicated to paid subscription features - users without a paid subscription would avoid this tab entirely rather than gradually and naturally encountering ways a paid subscription
          might enhance their experience</li>
        <li>Uploading vocab: Does not allow users to upload their own vocabulary</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The <em>competitive analysis</em> of Quizlet, Word of the Day and Word Up helped me discover strengths and weaknesses of potential competitors whilst allowing me to understand what types of features may be expected from users for a vocabulary
        app.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="interviews">
      <h1>Observe</h1>
      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
      <p>
        Now that I had a better understanding of the market space, it was time to get to know potential users through <em>interviews</em>. I interviewed five individuals who fit the target demographic for the app - people in their 20s and 30s who
        have recently engaged in educational activity that involved vocabulary learning.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What were some of the biggest challenges to achieve your purpose/goal for learning vocabulary?</li>
        <li>What methods did you use to learn new vocabulary? Which methods did/did not work for you? Why/why not?</li>
        <li>What kind of environment do you usually study in? How often was this true when you studied vocabulary?</li>
        <li>How often did you dedicate time to study new vocabulary? How long did you study per session?</li>
        <li>What was the most difficult about studying new vocabulary? What was the easiest?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Users cited lack of time associated with balancing their studies while working full-time as the biggest challenge to their goal of learning vocabulary. <em>So I found ways to make studying efficient and a habit (ex. copying a friend's
            vocabulary set and setting reminders).</em></li>
        <li>Users described a variety of ways they liked to study vocabulary: physical flashcards, studying with others, using apps, applying vocab to real life situations and more. <em>Therefore, I knew it would be important to implement a variety
            of study methods (ex. multiple choice, fill in the blank, matching) in my design.</em></li>
        <li>Users described a variety of environments they usually studied: cafes, surrounded by others studying, with/without background noise/music, at a desk/bed. <em>This helped me realize users need an app that can be used in many different
            settings.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The 5 W's</h2>
      <p>
        Based on the objective, problem statement, competitive analysis and user interviews, I determined the 5 W's to help guide the project.
      </p>
      <ul class="noStyleType">
        <li><em>What?</em> Vocabulary learning app</li>
        <li><em>Why?</em> For a course or a new skill</li>
        <li><em>Who?</em> People in their 20s and 30s</li>
        <li><em>When?</em> 5-10 minute increments</li>
        <li><em>Where?</em> On the go, in various settings</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        As a first time user researcher, I was grateful to be able to recruit friends to interview for this project. However, while reviewing the interview recordings, I noticed many ways I can improve as a researcher such as staying impartial,
        embracing silences to encourage interviewees to elaborate and asking relevant follow up questions to gather deeper insights.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="userPersonas">
      <h1>POV</h1>
      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>
        Now that I had a better understanding of real people who may use my vocabulary app, I created User Personas based on the interview analysis and summary.

      <h2>Jenna Flores</h2>

      <ul class="noStyleType">
        <li><em>Age</em>: 27</li>
        <li><em>Family status</em>: Single, no kids</li>
        <li><em>Work</em>: Talent Recruiter (Full-time)</li>
        <li><em>Education</em>: Bachelor’s in Psychology, pursuing a Master’s in Nursing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Behaviors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Commutes to and from work on public transportation (about 45 minutes)</li>
        <li>Connects with friends and family via social media on cell phone throughout the day</li>
        <li>Studies at a desk in home office setting in the evenings after work</li>
        <li>Makes flashcards to study vocabulary</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Needs & Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Needs to incorporate real world contexts for new vocabulary to better understand and remember them</li>
        <li>Wants to connect to classmates to study together and motivate each other</li>
        <li>Wants to take advantage of smaller chunks of time throughout the day to study</li>
        <li>Needs features that a physical deck of flashcards offers such as sorting and shuffling </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>As a full time worker pursuing a master's, I want to be able to specify times for my reminders so that I study more often during my lunch breaks and commute.</li>
        <li>As a Nursing student, I want to study with my classmates so that we keep each other motivated.</li>
        <li>As a student, I want to write my own definition of words so that making the flashcards is a part of the studying process.</li>
        <li>As a full time worker and part-time student, I want a quick way to sort flashcards into different piles so that I save time from reviewing words I already know.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Jenna needs a way to study in different environments such as a breakroom where she needs to be quiet or a loud train during her commute because she has limited time for studying and needs to take advantage of small chunks of time
        throughout the day. We will know this to be true when we see that Jenna is studying at various times of the day.</p>

      <h2>Hypothesis Statement</h2>
      <p>We believe that by providing multiple ways of reviewing vocabulary such as fill in the blank, multiple choice and matching pairs for Jenna, we will be able to accommodate the various environments and time constraints that Jenna has to
        study in and therefore achieve an increase in speed for learning vocabulary.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="userFlows">
      <h1>Ideate</h1>
      <h2>Task Analyses & User Flows</h2>
      <p>
        In the next portion of the Design Thinking Process “Ideate”, I created <em>task analyses</em> and <em>user flows</em> for two important tasks for my user persona Jenna.
      </p>

      <h2>Setting Study Reminder Notifications</h2>
      <p><em>Entry point</em>: Open menu</p>
      <p><em>Success criteria</em>: Personalize reminder notification times</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open app</li>
        <li>Open menu options</li>
        <li>Open profile</li>
        <li>Open profile settings</li>
        <li>Open reminders</li>
        <li>Add reminder</li>
        <li>Specify time</li>
        <li>Add additional reminder(s) (optional) </li>
        <li>Save</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Reviewing Vocabulary Using Multiple Choice</h2>
      <p><em>Entry point</em>: Select vocabulary words to review</p>
      <p><em>Success criteria</em>: Review vocabulary using multiple choice feature</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open app</li>
        <li>Select group of vocabulary words to review (optional - default selects all) </li>
        <li>Select multiple choice option</li>
        <li>Review vocabulary</li>
      </ol>

    <div id="wireframes">
      <h1>Prototype</h1>
      <h2>Wireframes & Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        At this point, I started the exciting process of <em>wireframing</em> the main features identified in the task analyses and user flows above. I created low-fidelity wireframes of StudyBuddy with its user persona and user flows in mind.
      </p>
      <div>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/studybuddy/wireframes@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/studybuddy/wireframes@2x.png" alt=" ">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        At the very beginning stages of wireframing, I found myself obsessing over details and element proportions. I had to consciously remind myself to embrace the trial and error mindset, knowing future iterations are inevitable. Through this
        experience, I learned the importance of using pen and paper. With more advanced tools like Figma or Adobe XD, I would not be able to practice rapid prototyping and rather, get stuck in the ideation stage for far too long for a version of
        the product that might not even hold up to usability testing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="usabilityTesting">
      <h1>Test</h1>
      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>
        In the final stage of this project, I conducted <em>usability testing</em> with four key user task scenarios on five participants.
      </p>

      <div>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/studybuddy/testing@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/studybuddy/testing@2x.jpg" alt=" ">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <p class="caption">
        Made using Miro
      </p>

      <h2>New Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        These changes were made based on the usability testing results
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linking to social accounts: language updated and process streamlined</li>
        <li>Onboarding: added “Skip all” option (if selected, coach mark would show where to access “Help” if needed in the future)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Recording usability testing sessions</em> During usability testing sessions, most participants seemed to navigate the prototype with ease, completing each task efficiently. However, upon review of the recordings, I found many instances
        in which participants quickly clicked through wrong pages before landing on the correct one. I would have missed these instances if not for the recordings, helping me realize the importance of recordings to review or better yet, having a
        second user researcher for future sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Making research backed decisions</em> While the major decisions and updates on the StudyBuddy app were based on user research, I made some smaller changes throughout iterations. While I know it's okay to make changes based on instinct,
        I realized that if working on a team, it wouldn't hurt to make changes based on user.
